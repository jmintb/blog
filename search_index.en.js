diving in, I want to make it clear that I am not(yet) an expert in compiler and language development. I have a bit of experience\nfrom my bachelor project which involved implementing a JIT compiler for a language developed by my university. This experience made me hungry\nfor more and served as inspiration for all sorts of ideas I want to try out. I will make plenty of mistakes and have to learn along the way.\nBy documentating the process you can learn from my mistakes as well :)\nOverview\nThis blog post is the first in (hopefully) a series on building and designing a programming language. For now the primary\nmotivation is to satisfy an urge I have To dig my teeth into language + compiler design and implementation.\nI have some existing ideas for the language I plan to build, those will get a separate post. for I will focus on getting \nthe practical setup out of the way.\nThe first couple of posts will serve as a sort of tutorial/introduction to the practical and theoretical aspects using the tools I have chosen (Rust, MLIR and pest).\nOnce the foundations have been set, I will start designing and implementing more involved aspects specific to the my language. I really need to find a name. \nI hope you stay for the journey :)\nThe first milestone is very simple and mostly serves as a way to get our project up and running. We will start by \nbuilding a minimal compiler that can compile: \nprintln(\"Hello World!\");\n\nand have \"Hello World!\" output to standard out.\nThis should be conceptually simple enough to wrap our heads around but involved enough to kick start the project and get our compiler stack setup.\nThis first post will focus on the defining a grammar powerful enough for prinln(\"Hello World!\") and generating a parser. A small introduction to compiler development\nwill precede the parser development, to help provide general compiler intuition for the uninitiated.\nLets go!\nAn introduction to compiling programming languages\nBefore we start it is important to have some intuition around the problem space. I assume that you have experience with using a programming language. \nIf not then you have my respect for starting your journey with how to build a programming language!\nBoth compiled and interpreted languages are quite common today. For example Python is a popular interpreted language and Rust is a compiled language.\nWe won't go deep into interpreted languages but the short version is, instead of preparing machine instructions a head of time, they are generated on\nthe fly as new code is fed to the interpreter. A longer explanation is found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing). One advantage\nhere is that code can be run immediately without the need to invoke a compiler. Two major disadvantages are poor performance and no compile time checks, for\nexample like checking types. \nWe will be focusing on the design and implementation of a compiled language.\nI am confident that a just in time(JIT) option will be \nsufficient to support dynamic/scripting purposes. This will also force us to keep compile times low, win win.\nWhat is a compiler?\nThe goal is to take input, often in the form of high level program, think Rust, C, Java etc and lower it to a different \nand hopefully well optimized representation that can be executed in some target environment. For general purpose programming languages this\nwill often be some type of machine code that the target environment can execute like an X86 processor or virtual machine like the JVM.\nThis will usually involve parsing the input to build an abstract syntax tree (AST), lowering to some intermediate representation or multiple intermediate representations \nuntil we end up with a representation the target environment can execute. \nWe will start with at the beginning, parsing our input.\nThe parser\nThe first step in our compiler pipeline is the parser. This step will build an AST and verify that the syntax is valid. \nWe could implement our own lexer, and for educational purposes I think that is a good exercise. However I will be using\nthe PEG parsing crate pest, it is an incredible tool for generating a parser based on a PEG grammar in Rust.\nThis also forces us to provide a specification for our language in the form of a grammar, win win. The grammar syntax\ncan be a bit daunting at first. Lets develop at simple grammar that will be sufficient.\nTo parse println(\"Hello World!\") we need a few pieces of syntax in our grammar. Function calls, identifiers and values in the form of strings. \nFor now print will be a built in provided by the compiler, so we do not need syntax for declaring functions, only calling them.\nPest provides helpful builtins for common string related cases.\nLets define strings first, we will start with the string defined for pest's JSON example and strip it down a bit.\nOur grammar now looks like this, we will initialize a Rust project in a moment:\n// grammar.pest\n\nchar = {\n    !(\"\\\"\" | \"\\\\\") ~ ANY\n}\n\ninner = @{ char* }\n\nstring = ${ \"\\\"\"\t~ inner ~ \"\\\"\" }\n\n\nPest has a rich syntax for specifying \ngrammar. Unless you are in the habit of writing grammars often you will want to check out the the pest book \nhere to familiarize your self with the options. \nWe now have three rules, one for single characters char, one for the string contents inner and one for the whole string surrounded by double quotes string.\nWe won't cover everything pest can do but breaking down our grammar hopefully provides a good starting point. \nThe char rule uses the any character but idiom. \nIn our case this means if the following characters is not \" or \\ consume one character.\nLooking at the char rule from left to write the ! acts as a negation, so !( \"\\\"\" | \"\\\\\" ) says reject the patterns in the parentheses, where | is the \nchoice operator. This operator will try to match on the provided options from left to right. Finally if the pattern is rejected \na single character is consumed using the builtin consumes one character denoted by the builtin ANY rule.\nIf you are wondering why these characters are not allowed, \" is used to define our strings and thus can not be included without being escaped \nand \\ will be used to escape characters.\nEscaping these characters is not strictly necessary yet. However it does set a nice foundation and shows of more of pest. So why not? \nA string contains an arbitrary number of characters, therefore the inner rule denotes exactly that with char*, where * indicates zero or more. The @ marks this rule \nas atomic. Atomic rules have the following special properties:\n\n~ means immediately follow by, so no white space. \nRepetition operators (* and +) have no implicit separation.\nRules inside an atomic rule are treated as atomic.\n\nThis is practical for parsing strings as we do not want to produce a token for each individual character. This also removes the implicit\nallowance of white space that normal rules have with ~. If you are wondering why have the inner rule at all and just put char* directly\ninside the string rule, that is a fair question. The inner rule contains the contents of a string without the surrounding\", if we removed it we would have to manually\nremove the surrounding quotes.\nWe now finally get to the string rule. A string is delimited by \", therefore our rule does exactly that \nstring = ${ \"\\\"\"\t~ inner ~ \"\\\"\" }. We look for a pair of \" with an inner between then. Note the $, it denotes string as\na compound atomic. This ensures that no implicit white space is permitted while\nstill collecting the inner rules for parsing. The example below will show this in action :)\nLets write some Rust and test our grammar.\nInit a cargo project, if you have not already and add the pest dependencies:\ncargo init --bin somelang \ncargo add pest pest_derive \n\nI believe that cargo add is a builtin option these days. If you are on an older version of cargo it can be installed with cargo-edit. \nOtherwise just add the dependencies manually to Cargo.toml as shown below :)\nYour Cargo.toml should look like this:\n[dependencies]\npest = \"2.6\"\npest_derive = \"2.6\"\n\nWe can now jump into src/main.rs and use our parser. Lets start by printing what a parsed string looks like.\nRemember to put the grammar defined earlier into grammar.pest in the same directory as Cargo.toml. Your directory should have the following structure:\nCargo.toml\nCargo.lock\ngrammar.pest\nsrc/main.rs\n...\n\nIn main.rs we:\n\n// Add the pest depdendencies\nuse pest::Parser;\nuse pest_derive::Parser;\n\n\n// Declare our Parser struct and derive the pest Parser trait.\n// As well as reference the file containing our grammar.\n#[derive(Parser)]\n#[grammar = \"grammar.pest\"]\npub struct LangParser;\n\nfn main() {\n    let input = \"\\\"hello world\\\"\".to_string();\n\n    // This parses the \"hello world\" string using the string rule.\n    let parsed_input = LangParser::parse(Rule::string, &amp;input).unwrap();\n\n    // We use #? to pretty the output for easy reading.\n    println!(\"{parsed_input:#?}\");\n}\n\n\nRunning cargo run should produce the following output.\n[\n    Pair {\n        rule: string,\n        span: Span {\n            str: \"\\\"hello world\\\"\",\n            start: 0,\n            end: 13,\n        },\n        inner: [\n            Pair {\n                rule: inner,\n                span: Span {\n                    str: \"hello world\",\n                    start: 1,\n                    end: 12,\n                },\n                inner: [],\n            },\n        ],\n    },\n]\n\nHere we can see the Pair which \nrepresents a matching pair of tokens and everything in between. In our case \" is the token\nmatched by the first Pair: span: Span { str: \"\\\"hello world\\\"\", start: 0, end: 13 }. \nThe inner field contains what ever the tokens spanned. In this case another Pair spanning the actual \nstring contents. The matching token pair is h and d. This might seem a bit counter intuitive\nbut our string contains any number of CHAR due to inner = { CHAR* } and char matches\non almost any character. An important observation here is that matching tokens for a Pair do not need to be the same, \nonly match the same rule. \nNote how the inner does not contain any CHAR rules but just the characters it spans. \nThis is due the fact that inner is atomic and does not permit \nwhite space between rules. string on the other hand is a compound atomic rule. \nIt will therefore have inner rules but still does not permit any white space between matches.\nFunction calls\nNext up let us expand our grammar to support function calls with a single input value. This will be the last addition required to print Hello World!.\nWe will start by extending our input in src/main.rs.\n    ...\n    let input = \"print(\\\"hello world\\\")\".to_string();\n    ...\n\nNow if we run cargo run we will get an error as our grammar does not support function calls yet. Lets fix that!\nWe will add 3 new rules, first  val = _{ string }. val represents a value. Right now we only support string values\nso val only contains the string rule. val is silent denoted by _. This means that it will note be visible in our\nparser. Instead we will see instances it's inner rules. This is nice as it saves us having to \"unwrap\" val instances, since we\nare always interested in it's contents.\nid = { ASCII_ALPHA+  } will represent an identifier of variables, functions, modules etc. For example println is an identifier. \nASCII_ALPHA+ indicates matches on one or more\nletters from a-z and A-Z. In future iterations we want to be support more characters but this will do for now. \nFinally call = ${ id ~  \"(\" ~ val  ~ \")\" }, which matches on a function call containing a single argument. \ncall consists of an identifier followed by a single argument surrounded by parentheses. \nExactly what we need! We make this rule compound atomic as we do not want white space between the \nidentifier and parentheses.\ngrammar.pest should now look like this.\n// grammar.pest\n\nchar = {\n    !(\"\\\"\" | \"\\\\\" ) ~ ANY\n}\n\ninner = @{ char* }\n\nstring = ${ \"\\\"\"\t~ inner ~ \"\\\"\" }\n\nval = _{ string }\n\nid = { ASCII_ALPHA*  }\n\ncall = ${ id ~  \"(\" ~ val  ~ \")\" }\n\n\nLets take it for a spin!. Running cargo run should still produce an error, as we have not updated which rule we use to parse this.\nIn src/main.rs update the parsing line to use Rule::call. \n    // src/main.rs\n    ...\n    let parsed_input = LangParser::parse(Rule::call, &amp;input).unwrap();\n    ...\n\nNow you should be able to run cargo run and get the parsed function call like this:\n[\n    Pair {\n        rule: call,\n        span: Span {\n            str: \"print(\\\"hello world\\\")\",\n            start: 0,\n            end: 20,\n        },\n        inner: [\n            Pair {\n                rule: id,\n                span: Span {\n                    str: \"print\",\n                    start: 0,\n                    end: 5,\n                },\n                inner: [],\n            },\n            Pair {\n                rule: string,\n                span: Span {\n                    str: \"\\\"hello world\\\"\",\n                    start: 6,\n                    end: 19,\n                },\n                inner: [\n                    Pair {\n                        rule: inner,\n                        span: Span {\n                            str: \"hello world\",\n                            start: 7,\n                            end: 18,\n                        },\n                        inner: [],\n                    },\n                ],\n            },\n        ],\n    },\n]\n\nAnd with that we are finished with the grammar, for now ;)\nThis post has grown quite long so we will continue in the next one. \nWhere we will actually use our parser and hopefully finish prinln(\"Hello World!\").\nAs a final step we will extract the identifier and argument, by traversing the parsed input as nested iterators.\nThis will help show how to work with pest.\n// src/main.rs\n...\n\n    // Get an iterator over the pairs matched by Rule::call\n    let mut call_pairs = parsed_input.into_iter().next().unwrap().into_inner();\n\n    // We know the id comes first.\n    let id = call_pairs.next().unwrap();\n\n    // And the function argument second.\n    // We extract the `inner` rule inside the matched `string`.\n    let argument = call_pairs.next().unwrap().into_inner();\n\n    println!(\"id: {}, argument: {}\", id.as_str(), argument.as_str());\n\n}\n\n\ncargo run should now produce:\nid: print, argument: hello world\n\nNote how hello world does not have surrounding quotes. This is because we went one level deeper. If we stopped at  argument =  call_pairs.next().unwrap we would have the string rule which\ncontains \". By calling into_inner we go one rule deeper and extract the matched inner which only holds the contents of a \nstring. \nTraversing our parsed input in this manner will allow us to build a proper AST one we are ready. I hope this example showed how \npowerful and simple pest allows us to get started parsing.\nClosing notes\nThanks for reading! I hope this post was informative and fun.
