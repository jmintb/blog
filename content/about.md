### Experience

#### Failed Bootstrap
**Company**: TeaInSpace

**Period**: 2022-07 - 2023-09

**Summary**: I left RE-ZIP to focus on boostrapping an MLOps based company. I had been hacking on a prototype MLOps platform informed by previous experience.
- Performed rapid early prototyping of a Kubernetes based approach validating the technical side of things before moving forward.
- Implemented multiple K8S controllers, Custom resources, CLIs and gRPC services in Rust and Go.
- Wrote documentation for most of the features.
- Ultimately decided to sunset the project for a few reasons: 
  1. I had not performed propper market research and had missed several strong incumbents.
  2. Burned my self out tring to meet a large companies requirements instead of releasing something simple early in the process and gauge community interest(This was my original plan).
  3. Realised that I was trying to exploit a business oppurtunity instead of working on a problem that needed solving which proved to be demotivating in the long run.

#### Head of IT

**Company**: [RE-ZIP](https://re-zip.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxuCnBhDLARIsAB-cq1o_z7teB4AaU04GBLa0RuAxazpu2lyCzlcImiq2tUMRNC3hCEdFuQ0aAuFWEALw_wcB)   
**Period**: 2021-07 to 2022-06
**Summary**: I was hired to maintain legacy systems while transitioning the company to a more maintainable tech stack.
- Developed a new administration dashboard, services and mobile application.
- Hired and managed interns.
- Suggested and implemented GPS based pick up points circumventing the need for setting up fixed barcodes at each location.
- Ultimately left the company relatively soon after starting as the workload was too high for something that was not my own.
- Documened and performed a thurrough handover of all new and legacy systems.

#### Student developer on Machine Learning Team
**Company**: [Salling Group](todo)

**Period**: 2020-07 to 2022-07

**Summary**: Designed, built and maintained  the MLOps infrastructure moving it from an on premises python script to a scalable and portable K8S based platform which is still in use today.
 Also experimented with various recommendation models for clothing based on visual similarity.

- Instilled software engineering practices into the team.
- Built a bespoke MLOps platform using K8S and Argo Workflows.
- Documented the system during handover so the team could maintain it them selves after I left even without K8S experts.
- Ensured that the infratructure reproducible and easy to update.
- Migrated the MLOps platform from an onpremises machine to AKS.
- Implemented a cost effecting cluster scaler using preimptive scheduling based on individual Job requirements.
- Developed simple SSH based remote access tooling for the team to use the on premises machine during covid(also still in use today). 
- Gathered data and experimented with techniques for recommding clothing based on visual simularity.
- Onboard and guided colleagues through expanding and working with the MLOps platform.

#### Student developer on API team
**Company**: [Salling Group](todo)
